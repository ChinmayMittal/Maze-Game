### Installation Instructions

We have tested the game on Ubuntu(20.04.4 LTS)

Ensure that g++ is installed on your system

On Linux, install the following libraries with the appropriate commands 

1. SDL

```
 sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

2. SDL_image

```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
```

3. SDL_ttf
```
sudo apt-get intstall libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

4. SDL_mixer
```
sudo apt-get intstall libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

clone our repository on your system using the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/ChinmayMittal/Maze-Game.git
```

Compile the code using the following command
```
make
```

To settup the server for the game we need the IP address of the host, use the following command

```
hostname -I
```

on one terminal run the server using the following command

```
./server/server.out
```
To run the game on two different PCs connected to the same network, on each PC run the following command
```
./game.out 10.184.24.96
```

here 10.184.24.96 is the IP address of the server found using hostname -I
